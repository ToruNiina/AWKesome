AWKesome
====

AWKesome is AWESOME awk function library to analyze the output of cafemol.

This also provide awk wrapper that makes running awk script dramatically easier.

## Install

add /path/to/awkesome/src/ to your command path. you will be able to run
awkesome awk-wrapper as

    $ awkesome 


## awkesome wrapper
AWKesome provides awk wrapper that makes running your awk script dramatically
easier. You can run your script like this.

    $ awkesome your_awesome_script.awk foo="foo" bar="bar"

You are now released from writing "-f" or "-v" options. And ofcourse, you can 
call AWKesome library files more easier like this.

    $ awkesome pdb matrix your_awesome_script.awk foo="foo" bar="bar"

Yes, you can call PDBReader as "pdb". And you can call
"-f path/to/lib/MatrixOperation.awk" as "matrix". wrapper also manages the
dependency of library files, so you don't have to mind the dependency at all.
You can successfully call the library if you do this.

    $ awkesome pdb pdb pdb pdb pdb your_awesome_script.awk

For more information, run

    $ awkesome --help

## sample scripts

there are two sample scripts in awksome repository.

### ContactMap
ContactMap.awk outputs the contact map of a certain model in pdb file.

    $awk -f lib/PDBReader.awk -f lib/Trigonometric.awk -f lib/VectorOperation.awk \
         -f src/ContactMap.awk -v threshold=6.5 -v pdbfile="hoge.pdb" -v model=1

or with AWKesome::wrapper,

    $awkesome pdb vector src/ContactMap.awk threshold=6.5 pdbfile="hoge.pdb" model=1

Here, _threshold_ is the threshold of distance that define a contact exists.
If the distance of certain pair of particle is lesser than this value,
the particles are considered as making contact.
_pdbfile_ is the name of PDB file you want to read.
_model_ is an ID of the model you want to read.

### RMSDCalculator
RMSDCalculator.awk calculates RMSD.

    $awk -f lib/PDBReader.awk -f lib/Trigonometric.awk -f lib/VectorOperation.awk \
         -f lib/utils.awk -f MatrixOperation.awk -f lib/JacobiMethod.awk \
         -f lib/BestFit.awk src/RMSDCalculator.awk -v ref=reference.pdb \
         -v movie=some.movie

or with AWKesome::wrapper,

    $awkesome pdb bestfit src/RMSDCalculator.awk ref=reference.pdb movie=some.movie

As reference structure, PDB file that contains CG-structure of the model is
required.
The reference PDB must not contain MODEL line.

In data/ directory, sample data that can be used for RMSDCalculation exist.
To try RMSDCalculator, do following way on top directory of this project.

    $awk -f lib/PDBReader.awk -f lib/Trigonometric.awk -f lib/VectorOperation.awk \
         -f lib/utils.awk -f MatrixOperation.awk -f lib/JacobiMethod.awk \
         -f lib/BestFit.awk src/RMSDCalculator.awk -v ref="./data/sh3_native.pdb" \
         -v movie="./data/sh3_native.movie" > sh3_rmsd.dat

or with AWKesome wrapper,

    $awkesome pdb bestfit ./src/RMSDCalculator.awk "./data/sh3_native.pdb" \
              movie="./data/sh3_native.movie" > sh3_rmsd.dat

If you want to test, compare the result and CafeMol's ts file.

Because ts file rounds the values, you find the difference between them at
a quick glance. But don't worry.

__NOTE__: This calculates only whole structure. Not each chain.

## Features of Library

AWKesome provides these useful awk functions.

### Trigonometric functions
- tan(theta)
- acos(theta)
- asin(theta)
- atan(theta)
using awk's function atan2(x, y)

### Utility functions
- abs(x)

### Vector Operation
AWKesome represents Vector3d as array of numbers. The values must be accessible
with index 0,1,2.

| name of function          | description                       |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| vec\_len\_sq(vec)         | returns squared length            |
| vec\_len(vec)             | returns length                    |
| vec\_add(lhs, rhs, ret)   | ret = lhs + rhs                   |
| vec\_sub(lhs, rhs, ret)   | ret = lhs - rhs                   |
| vec\_mul(vec, scl, ret)   | ret = vec * scl                   |
| vec\_div(vec, scl, ret)   | ret = vec / scl                   |
| vec\_dot(lhs, rhs)        | returns dot product               |
| vec\_cross(lhs, rhs, ret) | returns cross product             |
| vec\_angle(lhs, rhs)      | returns angle between lhs and rhs |
| vec\_print(vec)           | prints the vector                 |

### PDB Reader
AWKesome store the pdb data as pseudo-multidimentional array.
To read some pdb file in your awk script, call PDBread() this way.

    PDBread("filename", DATA, SIZE)

here, _DATA_ is name of data array that you want to store the information.
_SIZE_ contains the size of each array. You can get the number of models and 
particles in PDB file from SIZE in the way described below.

You can access the information in pdb file like this way.

| key                 | value        | example |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:--------|
| DATA[M,N,"RESIDUE"] | residue name | "THR"   |
| DATA[M,N,"ATOM"]    | atom name    | "CA"    |
| DATA[M,N,"CHAIN"]   | chain name   | "A"     |
| DATA[M,N,"RESID"]   | residue id   | 12      |
| DATA[M,N,"X"]       | x coordinate | 1.0000  |
| DATA[M,N,"Y"]       | y coordinate | 1.0000  |
| DATA[M,N,"Z"]       | z coordinate | 1.0000  |

here, _M_ means model index and _N_ means particle index.

Of course, you can get the number of models in pdb file and
number of particles in one model with SIZE array.

| key              | value                            |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------|
| SIZE["MODEL"]    | number of models in pdb file     |
| SIZE["PARTICLE"] | number of particles in one model |

__NOTE__: If you read a pdbfile that have no MODEL line, PDBReader stores the
model in DATA[0,N,"foo"] and SIZE["MODEL"] become zero. Please be careful.

### Matrix Operation
AWKesome represents Matrix as pseudo-multidimentional array of numbers.
About the same kind of functions as vector operation are supported.
See lib/MatrixOperation.awk.

### Jacobi Method
Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of symmetric matrix.
See lib/JacobiMethod.awk.

### BestFit
Calculate the best fit rotation and return the rotated structure.
See lib/BestFit.awk.

## Testing

AWKesome has some testing scripts. you can test the code.
